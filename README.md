# SU2-with-Harmonic-Balance-Method
The modification of program based harmonic balance method in the open-sourced SU2 (Stanford University Unstructured) tool suite with two-step approximate factorization technique is implemented. To further improve the computational efficiency, the MPI parallel computation technique, multigrid method and local time stepping method are applied into harmonic balance method.
